*I combined data from the world health association which organized different kinds of life expectancies with data from the UN about gender ratios per country and data from the world bank on average incomes per country. My goal is to explore the assocations of a country's average income, its life expectancies, and its gender ratio.*

```
*The initial MANOVA test showed that there was signicant mean difference of the three life expectancy variables across the four income groups. The ANOVA tests then showed each variable had a signifcant interaction with the variable of income group. The post hoc tests then showed that for overall life expectancy, male and female life expectancies that there were signifcant differences bewteen low and high income groups along with lower middle class and high income, and Upper Middle income and High income, Upper middle income and low income, and lower middle and upper middle incomes. This last result was much more pronounced in female life expectancy than male. The assumptions of the various test were likely met as the data consited of random samples and independent observations. Futher, the sample groups were large enough to avoid questions of normality and ther was likely equal variance between groups.*

(SSB/3)/(SSW/154)
})
mean(Fs>obs_F)
hist(Fs, prob=T); abline(v = obs_F, col="red",add=T)
```

*The null hypothesis is that life expectancy of both sexes does not differ significantly between income groups. My alternative hypothesis is that life expectancy of both sexes does differ significantly between income groups. Because I got a p value of 0, I am very confident in rejecting the null hypothesis.*

```

*Based on the coefficents, there is a slight interaction between life expectancy between the sexes and much larger interactions with the each of them and the overall life expectancy.More robust standard errors did not impact the results, indicating a strong model. My model accounts for nearly all off the variation (99.9142%).  *

*There is a significant positive association of Male life expectancy with a country with more men than women. There is also a significant negative association of Female life expectancy and a larger male sex ratio in a country.My model is not very sensitive but is relatively Specific and is medicoraly precise and accurate. *

    - Perform 10-fold (or repeated random sub-sampling) CV and report average out-of-sample Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Recall (10)

- **6.  Perform 10-fold CV using this model: if response in binary, compare model's out-of-sample accuracy to that of your logistic regression in part 5; if response is numeric, compare the residual standard error (at the bottom of the summary output, aka RMSE): lower is better fit!
